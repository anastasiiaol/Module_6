	<h3>TASK 6</h3>
<p>
		The summer music festivals on NYC’s packed calendar tend to follow a few basic rules. They’re outdoors. They’re often free (definitely check first to see if you need tickets). There’s usually good food—if not at the festival then nearby for you to pick up on the way. And they’re always fun. But how do you choose which ones best suit you?
	</p>
	<p>
		And which festival days and shows to hit? We’ve got the answers in our handy guide below.What it’s all about: It’s largely a celebration of jazz and blues music, but other genres are covered too: rockabilly, R&B, soul, salsa and samba, for a start. Most shows are ticketed concerts in small or midsize clubs, though a couple overlap with the SummerStage schedule (see above) and are free and outdoors.
